					<strong>
						In the beginning, God. Before all things in creation, there was God.
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/creation1.png" class="img-responsive" />
				</p>
				<p>
					He created all things. - Genesis 1
				</p>
				<p>
					He did it in 6 days... literally - Exodus 20:11
				</p>
				<p>
					When He finished, it was very good.
				</p>
				<p>
					He is a Spirit and by His unimaginable creativity He made everything we see, hear, touch, feel, taste, wonder about, etc. He made ALL things. His word tells us that all flesh is not the same flesh, but that bird, beasts of the field, fish, and mankind are made differently. He says that everything reproduces after its kind. Nothing reproduces another kind. He made it all just the way it is today. In the beginning it was perfect, it was very good.
					<a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/creation/biblicalCreation" target="_blank">[see Book 3, chapter 24]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/creation2.png" class="img-responsive" />
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						It was the human form of Jesus, who is the image of God, that He used as the blueprint for His design
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					While Jesus told us that God is a Spirit, we also know that the Divine Expression of God (the Word), the image of God, was something that God had imagined (the physical form of man) and this was the image in the mind of God at the very beginning whereby all things were made (by Him and for Him). Before the birth of Jesus Christ, God manifested His image on the earth several times to people in an angelic form (with Adam and Eve, Abraham, Jacob, Moses, etc.). This image, or Divine Expression, was made flesh in the body of Jesus Christ. God actually became part of His creation by being born into it as we are. He is amazing beyond comprehension!
					<a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/truth/TruthOfGodsWord" target="_blank">[see Book 2]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					He made us in His image, not only of his physical image (the body of Christ), but in His Spiritual image (our soul) as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					He created:
				</p>
				<p>
					Our five senses
				</p>
				<p>
					The beauty of canyons, lakes, rivers, oceans, mountains, animals, birds, fish, etc...
				</p>
				<p>
					The universe and the galaxies and everything in them
				</p>
				<p>
					Music
				</p>
				<p>
					Love, joy, laughter
				</p>
				<p>
					Humor
				</p>
				<p>
					Smells
				</p>
				<p>
					Touch
				</p>
				<p>
					Taste
				</p>
				<p>
					The human form in all of its complexity and beauty
				</p>
				<p>
					The mind
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						He put Adam and Eve in the beautiful Garden of Eden
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/creation3.png" class="img-responsive" />
				</p>
				<p>
					He knew that given free will and left to our own devices that we would fall from His intended purpose and that we would sin. His plan was and is to save as many of us as is possible. He gave Himself, as a sacrifice for us, so that we might be saved from our sin and return to the glory He intended for us from the beginning. He&#39;s growing His crop, so to speak, and the culmination of His plan is coming to the full and is about to be a finished work!

						They only had one rule
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Don&#39;t eat of the tree in the middle of the garden
				</p>
				<p>
					Satan, one of the angels God created when He created the universe, lied to Eve and deceived her (Genesis 3) -
					<a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/videos/angelsVideo" target="_blank">Watch my Angels video to see who and what angels are</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					He asked her if God really said that... this is the same way he deceives us today a lot of times
				</p>
				<p>
					He told her she could be as a god, herself
				</p>
				<p>
					She believed him and ate of the tree
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/theFall1.png" class="img-responsive" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Adam &quot;listened to the voice of his wife&quot; instead of obeying God and ate as well when she gave him some (Genesis 3:17)
				</p>
				<p>
					We don&#39;t know how long they were in the garden before they sinned, but we know it was sometime before Adam was 130 years old
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						Because of their disobedience, God expelled them from the garden and changed things in the world
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Thorns and thistles came into being
				</p>
				<p>
					Pain in child-birth

					Having to till the ground by the sweat of your brow to grow food

					Cain, Able, and Seth
				</p>
				<p>
					Adam lived a total of 930 years and had many sons and daughters

						Sin began to rule in the hearts of men
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Cain killed Able because he was jealous of the favor God bestowed on Able
				</p>
				<p>
					Able&#39;s offerings were acceptable to God
				</p>
				<p>
					Cain&#39;s offering were not acceptable to God (he was probably unwilling to give God anything good from his harvest - see Genesis 4:5, Hebrews 11:4, 1 John 3:12)
				</p>
				<p>
					It is unknown how many other children had been born by then, but we know that Cain took a wife of one of his sisters or cousins
				</p>
				<p>
					A very conservative estimate (the women only having one daughter every 20 years) is that there was likely over a million people on the earth by the time of Jared, and over a billion a thousand years later at the time of the flood.
				</p>
				<p>
					The lifespan of people before the flood was in the hundreds of years and they were having sons and daughters continually
				</p>
				<p>
					Everyone lived hundreds of years before the flood – and had sons and daughters
				</p>
				<p>
					Seth was born when Adam was 130 years old to replace Able (who was the descendant that would produce the line which eventually produced Jesus)
				</p>
				<p>
					In the time of Jared, who was born in the year 460 AA (After Adam), other selfish and wicked angels like Satan came to earth and corrupted the people of the earth by taking human wives and teaching them many evil things like war and the tools of war, abortion, witchcraft and sorcery, etc.
					(Genesis 6:2-4) and <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/notes/Enoch" target="_blank">from the book of Enoch</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						By the year 1550 AA (after Adam) there was only evil continually in the hearts of men and the earth was filled with violence
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Gen 6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
				</p>
				<p>
					Gen 6:11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.

						God destroyed the earth, but thanks to Noah he spared mankind - year 1656 AA
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Noah loved the Lord and was obedient to Him
				</p>
				<p>
					Noah was the great grandson of Enoch
				</p>
				<p>
					Noah and Methuselah (Enoch&#39;s son and grandfather of Noah) preserved <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/notes/Enoch" target="_blank">the words of Enoch</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Noah was 600 years old at the flood and lived another 350 years after the flood
				</p>
				<p>
					Noah only had three sons that we&#39;re told about, but no mention of how many daughters
				</p>
				<p>
					The flood lasted a year
				</p>
				<p>
					God opened the windows of heaven and the fountains of the great deep and flooded the entire earth
				</p>
				<p>
					Gen 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of
					the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
				</p>
				<p>
					When God broke up the fountains of the great deep and opened the windows of
					heaven, we had a storm like no other storm!&nbsp; Have you ever heard of or seen
					a geyser that spews hot scalding water because of the pressure from the
					tremendous heat under the surface that causes it to release periodically?&nbsp;
					Have you heard about the massive, huge fields of lava flow that scientists can’t
					explain?&nbsp; The fountains of the great deep erupted with tremendous heat!&nbsp;
					When the windows of heaven were opened, for the first time in the history of the
					earth, the super cold of space (459.6 degrees below zero) came down into our
					atmosphere.&nbsp; You probably know that when a cold front meets a warm front
					that there’s going to be some stormy weather, right?&nbsp; Imagine what happened
					when that super frigid cold met with super heated water, lava and air?&nbsp; The
					surface of this planet was caught in a storm that makes a hurricane look like a
					single little harmless rain cloud. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/creation/flood" target="_blank">See study page here</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					He preserved every kind of animal and Noah and his family on the Ark that He had Noah build
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/noahArkAnimals.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the time-frames we're given, it took Noah about 100 years to build the Ark

					Joseph, the great grandson of Abraham, was sold by his brothers into slavery
				</p>
				<p>
					Joseph never lost faith while a slave and in prison in Egypt
				</p>
				<p>
					God gave him dream interpretation to impress Pharaoh
				</p>
				<p>
					Joseph became the ruler of Egypt, second only to Pharaoh
				</p>

				<p>
					They became a great nation in Egypt
				</p>
				<p>
					Numbers 1:46 shows that there were over 600,000 men of military age while they were in the desert after coming out of Egypt
				</p>
				<p>
					When you factor in the elderly, women and children, and the tribe of Levi, there would have been at least a couple million of them easily
				</p>

				<p>
					During the time in Egypt, they were enslaved by the Egyptians, which God allowed because Israel worshipped the false gods of Egypt
				</p>
				<p>
					Josh 24:14 Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						God used Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The power of God bringing them out was awesome
				</p>
				<p>
					He sent many plagues against Egypt so they would give up and let the Israelites go
				</p>
				<p>
					God opened up the Red Sea, with walls of water on both sides, so they Israelites could cross, and then collapsed the water on the Egyptians behind them
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/redSea.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
				</p>
				<p>
					When Moses was on the mountain with God, getting the Law and the 10 Commandments, the people turned to worshipping a false god (a golden calf)
				</p>
                <p>
                    They spent 40 years in the desert because they did not trust God to lead them into the promised land – but even their garments did not wear out the whole time and God provided food
                </p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/wilderness.png" class="img-responsive" />
				</p>
				<p>
					God established the law in the wilderness – to be a schoolmaster for us to know it&#39;s impossible to be righteous in our own strength
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						God brought Israel into the promised land (the promise He made to Abraham)
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/promisedLand.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Israel is established forever and God put His name in Jerusalem.
				</p>
				<p>
					Israel will never be wiped off the map as the Muslims are trying to do
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus will return and defend Israel when the Antichrist attempts to wipe it out in the last day
				</p>
				<p>
					Israel disobeyed God when they came into the land
				</p>
				<p>
					God knew that if they left the peoples and married the women where they had false religions, that the Israelites would be corrupted
				</p>
				<p>
					They disobeyed God and allowed some of them to live among them
				</p>
				<p>
					Because of this, they became corrupt many times during the next centuries and the Phillistines (Palistinians) are still a problem for Israel today
				</p>
				<p>
					Judges 2:2-3 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this? Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.

						450 years of Judges

				</p>
				<p>
					God established Judges over Israel to help decide matters of dispute among the people
				</p>
				<p>
					During the time of judges, the people did what was right in their own eyes

				<p>
					<strong>
						Then, they wanted a king like other peoples around them had

				</p>
				<p>
					1 Sam 12:12-13 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king. Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired ! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Acts 13:21-23 And afterward they desired a king : and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years. And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will. Of this man&#39;s seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:
				</p>
				<p>
					David, the great king and a man after Gods own heart, is the ancestor and blood line of Jesus Christ
				</p>
				<p>
					David began the golden age of Israel
				</p>
				<p>
					Solomon, Davids son, was the wisest man who ever lived

					God forgave them every time they turned back to Him

					<strong>
						Approximately 600 BC (3400 AA), the time of the Babylonian captivity
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Prophets like Ezekiel and Jeremiah prophesied of the wickedness of Israel and how God was going to allow Babylon to conquer Israel
				</p>
				<p>
					Daniel, a young man at the time Babylon conquered Israel, was taken to be a slave in the palace of Babylon
				</p>
				<p>
					Daniel becomes a high official in Babylon due to Gods favor on him (because he loved the Lord)
				</p>
				<p>
					God gives Daniel dream interpretation and many prophetic visions during his time in Babylon
				</p>
				<p>
					Below is the Daniel 2 prophecy of the line kings (who control the known world) from the time of Babylon until return of Jesus
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						PROPHECY OF DANIEL - the line of kings from Babylon to the return of Jesus
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Babylon (Babel) controls the known world at this time - this is the beginning of the prophecy of Daniel 2
				</p>
				<p>
					Daniel interprets the dream of King Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel chapter 2. He saw an image that had a head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of brass, legs of iron, and feet of iron mixed with clay with ten toes of part iron and part clay. Each of these sections represents a world dominating power. Many nations have existed since that time, but the sections represent world domination (of the known world) as stated in Daniel 2:39.
				</p>

				<p>
					A very popular theory for this passage is that it is a parallel prophecy of Daniel 7, where it lists the four kingdoms that will exist at the time of the return of Christ.
					This cannot be true for a couple reasons. First, there are five sections to the statue in Daniel 2 and there areonly four beasts in Daniel 7. Second, if we continue to
					read <em>
						Daniel 7: 11 I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given
						to the burning flame. 12 As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
					</em> We see that the
					fourth beast, the little horn (the Antichrist and his one world government), is destroyed and the other three beasts (the lion, bear, and leopard) have their dominion
					taken away but they live on for a while. If this is a parallel prophecy with Daniel 2, then the empires (Babylon, Media/Persia, Greek, Roman) would all
					still have to be in existence when Christ returns, but they are not and can not. This is definitely a different prophecy with kingdoms differing from the kingdoms we
					see in Daniel 7. The common factor is that they end at the same place with the return of the Lord. So we know for certain that these are consecutive kingdoms and are
					not the same nations we find in Daniel 7. But, like other prophecies discussed in this book, the two have a common intersection at the end. When the stone smote the
					image and became a great mountain; verses 44 and 45 tell us that it&#39;s the same declaration as we found in Daniel 7:9. It is the end of this age when the Lord
					returns, casts down the nations and the governments of the world, and sets up His kingdom on the earth. Lastly, in Revelation 13 we see that the four beasts of
					Daniel 7 become one beast, the united government of the Antichrist (The New World Order). All four beasts exist at that time! They are not kingdoms of the past.

				<p>
					<strong>
						Gold – Babylon
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Babylon ruled until the Medes and the Persians conquered Babylon in 539 BC.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						Silver – Media-Persia
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Medes and Persians ruled until Alexander the Great defeated them in 331 BC.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						Brass – Greece
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Grecian empire lasted until the Romans defeated them in 197 BC.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						Iron – Rome
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Roman empire lasted about 500 years until it decayed from within and was overrun by barbarians around 300 AD. This was the largest of the empires controlling most of Europe and the Middle East nations. In 325 AD Emperor Constantine created the Catholic Church in an attempt to re-unify Roman rule and as time went on the Roman Catholic Church grew in power within the Western splinter of the old Roman Empire as well as the Eastern (or Greek) Orthodox Catholic Church until Charlemagne was crowned &quot;Emperor&quot; of the Holy Roman Empire in 800 AD. During this same period of time, the Islamic Empire in the Middle East was rising and became the Islamic Ottoman Empire around 1300 AD.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						Iron and Clay – Holy Roman / Islamic Ottoman Empire
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The iron is mingled with clay because it’s a continuation of the Roman Empire via the Holy Roman Empire but was broken in two parts, co-existing with the Islamic Ottoman Empire. The Holy Roman Empire controlled the nations of the northern Roman Empire (Europe) while the Islamic Empire controlled the Middle Eastern nations of the Roman Empire. Both of these Empires together comprised the total area controlled by the Roman Empire.
				</p>
				<p>
					The language used in this prophecy says that this kingdom is “divided” and “partly strong and partly broken”. It is divided because it is two kingdoms who controlled the same area.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Holy Roman Empire was founded when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne in 800 AD and proclaimed him to be the first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. The Holy Roman Empire has risen and fallen many times since then (partly strong and partly broken) and has always been ruled by both a religious leader and a political leader. We still have a “Charlemagne prize” which was awarded to Bill Clinton in 2000 and was awarded to Javier Solana in 2007. This prize is awarded to the person who does the most for the reunification of Europe.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Islamic Empire began after Muhammad created his monotheistic Muslim religion and it spread rapidly among Arab nations. It, like the Holy Roman Empire, rose and fell many times (partly strong and partly broken) until the Ottoman Empire was founded around 1300 AD and continued until 1923. The modern Arab League mirrors the EU in that is uniting the Muslim nations in the same type of economic cooperative but membership is based on it&#39;s Muslim culture rather than geographic locality.
				</p>

				<p>
					Both of these Empires still exist in spirit within the nations they controlled. The EU and the Islamic Nations of the Middle East.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Bible tells us that the Antichrist and the False Prophet of the bible will revive and unite these two kingdoms to create the End Time world government, the New World Order. This is the iron mingled with clay that follows the Roman Empire, the last kingdom that will exist before the return of Christ, and will be the power base that the Antichrist uses to control the world.
				</p>

				<p>
					The ten toes agree with the ten horns, or ten kingdoms we talked about in the “<a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/ModernNations" target="_blank">Modern nations in the Bible</a>” chapter. Meaning there will be a ten nation, or ten state union in the end time that will produce and give power to the Antichrist as shown to us in Revelation 17:8-14. It&#39;s interesting that Russia has ten &quot;states&quot; today. It’s also interesting that the Western European Union, the military wing of the EU, is a group of ten nations that Javier Solana heads up. It&#39;s absolutely certain that European nations will be part of the New World Order, and the ten kings could come from Europe. It&#39;s also possible that the ten nations will emerge from the Islamic nations giving their power to what they will believe is their Mahdi.
				</p>

				<p>
					Verse 44 predicts that, “in the days of these kings”, in the days of the Holy Roman Empire, will the God of heaven set up His kingdom which shall never be destroyed.
				</p>

				<p>
					This is the same declaration as the one we saw in Daniel 7 and the seventh trumpet: Rev 11:15 And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.
				</p>

				<p>
					That means that the Holy Roman / Islamic Ottoman Empire will be the last world dominating power and will exist when Jesus returns to set up His kingdom. I am certain that this will be a union of Roman Catholicism and Islam, as you can see in chapter 7.

						The prophecy of Daniel&#39;s 70 weeks
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Daniel served under Nebuchadnezzar from the time he was a young man and continued serving Cyrus of Persia and Darius the Mede when he was an old man.
				</p>
				<p>
					Daniel's prophecy of 70 weeks (70 weeks of years in Daniel 9) said it would be 483 years (the first 69 weeks) until the Messiah (Jesus) from the time
					of the commandment to rebuild Jerusalem.
				</p>
				<p>
					This command was given in Ezra chapter 1 with king Cyrus.
				</p>
				<p>
					70 weeks (of years) - 490 year prophecy but last 7 broken out from the bulk (for a reason)
				</p>
				<p>
					Dan 9:24-27 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of
					abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first 69 weeks were fulfilled after the command to rebuild Jerusalem - 483 years to Jesus Christ
				</p>
				<p>
					He, &quot;the prince that shall come&quot;, (the Antichrist) will confirm the covenant for one week (a week of years).
				</p>
				<p>
					The final 7 years are yet to come, and will be marked by the Confirmation of the Covenant, which will be when the world (the UN, EU, Arab League, and other nations of the world) defines the borders of Israel and establishes the status of Jerusalem

						From Abraham to Joseph 250 years
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						Joseph to Moses approx 200 years (about 470 years total from Abraham to the Exodus and entrance to the promised land)
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						Moses to David 450 years
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						David to Daniel approx 500 years
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						Daniel to Jesus about 600 years
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>

					The Bible shows the exact years from Creation to Abraham (approx 2000 years).

				</p>
				<p>

					Adam was 130 years old when he begat Seth, who was 105 years old when he begat Enos, who was 90 years old when he begat Cainan, who was 70 years old when he begat Mahalaleel, who was 65
					years old when he begat Jared, who was 162 years old when he begat Enoch, who was 65 years old when he begat Methuselah, who was 187 years old when he begat Lamech, who was 182
					years old when he begat Noah, who was 500 years old when he begat Shem, who was 100 years old when he begat Arphaxad, who was 35 years old when he begat Selah, who was 30
					years old when he begat Eber, who was 34 years old when he begat Peleg, who was 30 years old when he begat Reu, who was 32 years old when he begat Serug, who was 30
					years old when he begat Nahor, who was 29 years old when he begat Terah, who was 70 years old when he begat Abraham, who was 100 when he begat Isaac. Total of 1946 years from
					Creation to Abraham (2046 to when God made the promises to Abraham and Isaac was born).

				</p>
				<p>

					Then, we see it was another 2000 years from Abraham to Jesus.

				</p>
				<p>

					From Abraham, when he was about 100 years old, to the actual conquering of the promised land was 470 years.

				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<em>
								Ex 12:40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.
							</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>
								Gal 3:16 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one,
								And to thy seed, which is Christ. 17 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ,
								the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.
							</em>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									From the time of the promise to bringing Israel out of Egypt and creation of the Law, was about 430 years.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<em>
								Acts 7:6 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage,
								and entreat them evil four hundred years.
							</em>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									Abraham was 100 when he begat Isaac, so his "seed" sojourned in a strange land (the area of Egypt) about 400 years until God brought Israel out of Egypt.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Abram (renamed to Abraham later by God) was 75 when God called him out of Haran to sojourn in a strange land and made the promise to him and
							his seed (Gen 12)
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The time Israel spent in the wilderness was 40 years.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							So, the total time Abraham and his seed spent sojourning in Egypt was 430 years plus 40 years in the wildnerness, which comes to 470 years
							from the promise to the fulfillment when Israel went into the promised land.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>

					Acts 13:20 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.

				</p>
				<p>

					The time of the Kings was approximately 500 years until Nebuchadnezzar invaded Israel. The Bible shows time frames that match perfectly with archeological digs and
					historical information uncovered, proving the date ranges.

				</p>
				<p>

					Daniel served under Nebuchadnezzar from the time he was a young man and continued serving Cyrus of Persia and Darius the Mede when he was an old man.

				</p>
				<p>

					Daniel's prophecy of 70 weeks (70 weeks of years in Daniel 9) said it would be 483 years (the first 69 weeks) until the Messiah (Jesus) from the time of the commandment
					to rebuild Jerusalem.

				</p>
				<p>

					This command was given in Ezra chapter 1 with king Cyrus.

				</p>
				<p>

					So we have approximately 2000 years total to the birth of Jesus Christ.

						4000 AA - 0 BC/AD - Jesus Christ was born

					Jesus was born and God Himself was manifest in the flesh of Jesus Christ

					John 1:14 And the Word [the Divine Expression of God] was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
				</p>
				<p>
					1 Tim 3:16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Jews didn&#39;t like what Jesus taught and preached, so they killed Him (God knew this would happen, and purposely let them kill Him so He could die in our place)
				</p>
				<p>
					He died sinless but was tempted just as we are
				</p>
				<p>
					He paid the penalty for OUR sin and died in our place so we can live into eternity with Him
				</p>

				<p>
					He rose again after 3 days
				</p>
				<p>
					It's important to understand that the day Christ was crucified was Thursday. Most people are very confused about this, since it was the
					"day before the Sabbath" that He was crucified, and Jesus rose "the day after the Sabbath", and most people believe and teach that this
					was referring to a single Saturday Sabbath day. The thing is, the Passover is a High Holy Day and like all High Holy Days it is also a
					Sabbath day. So in this year, the Passover Sabbath was on Friday, and there were two Sabbath days back to back. The Passover Sabbath on
					Friday, and then the regular Saturday Sabbath on Saturday. Jesus was crucified on Thursday morning, the day of preparation for the
					Passover Sabbath, and rose again on Sunday morning, three days later.
					<a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/theGospels/theGospels11" target="_blank">See more about this here</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					He spent 40 days with the disciples and taught them many things, of which only some is shown to us in the New Testament Epistles
				</p>

				<p>
					He was seen by hundreds of people, and confirmed to be risen from the dead
				</p>
				<p>
					1 Cor 15:4-8 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.
				</p>

				<p>
					He was then taken up into heaven and is now the &quot;right hand of power&quot; of God, where He is the body of God, the image of the invisible God, the Express image of Gods person
				</p>
				<p>
					Luke 22:69 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mark 14:62 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

						70 AD Jerusalem and Temple destroyed as prophesied by Jesus
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Matt 24:1-2 And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 70 AD, the Romans destroyed Jerusalem. &nbsp;During the destruction, fire was set
					to the Temple. The fire caused the gold inlay on the Temple ceiling and walls to
					melt. The melting gold flowed into crevices within the stones. The Romans pried
					apart the stones to remove the gold. This fulfilled Jesus&#39; prophecy that not one
					stone would be left standing on another.

					<strong>
						The Apostle John was imprisoned on Isle of Patmos for his faith in Jesus
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/patmos.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
				</p>
				<p>
					There, John was given the visions of Revelation (the Revelation of Jesus Christ)
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus is the mystery of God, therefore His revelation to the world is monumental
					<a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/truth/TheologyVsPhilosophy#theMystery" target="_blank">More information on this study page</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Book of Revelation begins with John on
					the isle of Patmos, where he had been exiled, and he heard a voice.&nbsp; The
					voice is that of Jesus Christ, as we see in verses 8, 11, 17 and 18.&nbsp; He is
					the first and the last, and he that lives and was dead but is alive for
					evermore.&nbsp; In verse 19 he tells John to write things he has seen, things
					which are and things that are to come.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						Rev 1:19 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and
						the things which shall be hereafter;
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					The book of Revelation can be divided into these three distinct categories:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							Things John has seen.&nbsp; In chapter one John records having seen Jesus Christ
							Himself.&nbsp; The things seen and heard during this experience are the &quot;things
							which thou hast seen&quot;.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							&quot;Things which are&quot; represent things that are in John&#39;s present world.&nbsp;
							Chapters 2 and 3 are letters to the seven churches “which are in Asia”. These
							churches existed at that time in Asia.&nbsp; Some people, assuming that the
							entire book of Revelation is prophetic, have put forth a theory that the seven
							churches must be church &quot;ages&quot; of the future.&nbsp; That is simply not true.&nbsp;
							The truth is that the messages to the seven existing churches of that time are
							the &quot;things which are&quot;.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Revelation 4:1 begins the &quot;things which shall be hereafter&quot;.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					<i>
						Rev 4:1 After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and
						the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which
						said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.

					<strong>
						The &quot;things which must shortly come to pass&quot; (Rev 1:1)
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					325 AD the inception of the Catholic church – almost a certainty to be the opening of the first Seal
				</p>
				<p>
					The seals and trumpets and prophecies of the last days, including Daniels 70th week
				</p>
				<p>
					Revelation 1:3 states that the “time is at hand”. In God&#39;s time, a thousand years to
					God is as a day to us (Ps 90:4, 2 Pet 3:8). And, if the first Seal is opened
					around 325 AD with the founding of the Catholic church, then a couple hundred
					years after this was written is really “at hand” in God&#39;s time.
				</p>
				<p>
					1:19 states that things “shall be hereafter”. Does this mean that it&#39;s going to
					be a long time in the future, or shall start shortly after this was stated? It
					certainly doesn&#39;t prove that it either way but seems to indicate that it won't be a long time.
					Especially since 1:1 says they must "shortly come to pass", and 1:3 says the "time is at hand".
				</p>
				<p>
					Another interesting point is in verse 20, where we see that the churches each have an angel assigned to them. If you <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/videos/angelsVideo" target="_blank">watch my Angels video</a>, you'll
					see that angels are used by God for many things, and that we can fully expect that angels are very busy on the earth right now!
				</p>
				<p>
					Chapters 2 and 3 are the letters John delivered to the seven churches that existed at that time, 2000 years ago. <span class="auto-style1">They are very useful</span> to us in that they
					give us great instruction on how to be pleasing to the Lord and how we should obey Him and cease from sin, and should not be lukewarm.
				</p>
				<p>
					I highly recommend studying them deeply.
				</p>
				<p>
					3:3 says that if we don&#39;t watch, He will come as a thief and you&#39;ll be
					surprised. If we succumb to false doctrine we aren&#39;t watching, in my opinion,
					and we&#39;ll be surprised. When He comes for the whole world to see, we will be taken off-guard, and we should not be.

					Rev 21:3-5 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow , nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.

				<p>
					<B>The final seven years &ndash; the road to Armageddon </B>
				</p>
				<p>
					We’ve already discussed several of the major events that will happen in the
					final seven years. I’m not going to go into great detail here but I am
					hoping to help you understand what&#39;s coming right now and in the very near
					future.
				</p>
				<p>
					The confirmation of the covenant discussed previously is the event that marks
					the beginning of the final seven years. This confirmation has not happened yet.
					The Quartet, or the Big Four; the EU, UN, US and Russia, have met to confirm the
					“Roadmap for Peace” in the Middle East several times but can&#39;t make it stick
					yet. The plan includes all the necessary steps to confirm the covenant. Today
					the Arab League and the Quartet along with other entities are doing everything
					they can to establish a Palestinian state and bring an agreement together
					between Israel and Palestine. Israel leaders have even stated that they are
					willing to share sovereignty of the Temple Mount and give the West Bank (Judea)
					back to the Palestinians. There have been many meetings of all the powers
					I just mentioned in the last few years, that could very well lead to this event that God calls the
					Confirmation of the Covenant. If they decide on a plan and implement it and make
					it stick, where the borders of Israel are drawn and the Temple Mount is shared,
					then it IS that event and that means that from that day, the day that it actually happens and they sign a treaty, there will only be 7
					years remaining until the Battle of Armageddon and the return of Jesus Christ!
				</p>
				<p>
					And, in the end of 2017 with President Trump declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and
					Russia's Putin saying he recognizes West Jerusalem as the capitol of Israel, as well as the Saudi's coming on board,
					it seems that this event is truly imminent today!
				</p>
				<p>
					Everything else necessary for the end time to be upon us has happened or is
					happening now. Most people think it cannot happen because the Jewish temple has
					not been rebuilt, but the temple does not have to be standing until half way
					through the final seven years (when the abomination of desolation takes place),
					and you should know that an organization called the Sanhedrin, working with the
					Temple Institute in Israel, is planning on rebuilding the temple off-site, just
					as the first temple was built, and when the temple mount is shared (probably
					placed under UN security control) they will be able to put it together very
					quickly. All of the utensils, furniture, clothing, etc., is completely finished
					and ready for use in the temple, and the blueprints and plans for the temple
					itself are done (they used to have them online, but they are being kept secret to avoid
					causing Muslims to attack and cause problems before they can finish).
					When I visited Israel in 2007 I stood next to the corner stone they have ready
					to place as soon as they get permission to build the temple. Many people also
					believe that the Muslim mosque will have to be torn down in order to rebuild the
					temple, but recent discoveries have shown that the actual location for the
					Jewish Temple is over a place that is currently called the Dome of the Spirits,
					where there is adequate room to build the temple. The temple mount will be
					shared, and we know this because John was told to measure the Temple in Rev
					11:1-2 but was told to leave out the outer court because it would be occupied by
					Gentiles for three and a half years. It will likely be policed by UN
					peacekeepers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The sixth trumpet war may happen sometime in the first 3 ½ years of this final
					seven. I can’t say that it will positively happen during that time, but it
					certainly looks like it, and here’s why I think so: Revelation 9 explains the
					sixth trumpet, but the seventh trumpet doesn’t sound until the end of the 11<sup>th</sup>
					chapter. Revelation 10 talks about an angel who places his right foot on the sea
					and his left foot on the earth, and John is instructed to seal up the words of
					the seven thunders. In Daniel 12:4, Daniel is also instructed to shut up the
					words, and when the man in Daniel 12:6 asked, “How long shall it be to the end
					of these wonders?” he is told by an angel standing on the waters that it will be
					a time, times and an half, or 3 ½ years. Revelation 11 goes on to talk about the
					things that will happen in the final 3 ½ years, like the two witnesses who
					“shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days”, or 3.45 years. Then
					the sounding of the seventh trumpet happens in the end of chapter 11. This may
					be an indication that the sixth trumpet will happen before the halfway point of
					the final seven years. As I prove to be fact in Chapter 10 on BibleProphecyAndTruth.com,
					however, just because something is nestled in between something else in
					Revelation, it does not prove that we&#39;re in a sequential time for the events to
					take place.
				</p>
				<p>
					Don't forget, however, the Fifth Trumpet has almost certainly not sounded yet, so that will have to happen first!
				</p>
				<p>
					If it does happen just before the Antichrist takes over, what better way for the
					Antichrist to take power than when the world awakes to 2 billion dead? Since we
					know he takes power at the half-way point, or 3.5 years into the final seven,
					and that he uses peace as a weapon, it would be a big stepping stone for his
					agenda when the world is clamoring for peace after a nuclear war. Also, a
					calamitous world event like another world war is what Muslims believe will usher
					in their Mahdi. Muslims like Iran&#39;s president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad believe they
					can actually hasten the coming of the Mahdi by creating the world chaos
					necessary for him to come and “save the world”.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a name="abomination"></a>
					<b>The Abomination of Desolation</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Abomination of Desolation will take place at the halfway point of the final
					seven years. This event is when the Antichrist will stand in the “holy place”,
					the rebuilt temple in Jerusalem, and claim to be God. He may not say it
					outright. The deceiver is the Master of Lies! Don’t be fooled if you don’t hear
					on the news that he actually said he is God, but he may be arrogant enough to
					actually say so. The event will be one that we know about and can recognize for
					what it is because we know what to look for. This is when he will take over the
					world.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						Matt 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
						for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. 15 When ye
						therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the
						prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) 16 Then
						let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					The event Jesus is referring to in Matthew 24:15 is Daniel 9:27 and Daniel
					11:31. The Antichrist will confirm the covenant for seven years and will be an
					abomination to God and will make it (the holy place; the Temple) desolate.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						Dan 9:27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the
						midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and
						for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the
						consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						Dan 11:31 And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the
						sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall
						place the abomination that maketh desolate.
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						2 Thess 2:4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God,
						or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple
					</i> <i>
						of God,
						shewing himself that he is God.
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					This event Paul is referring to in 2 Thessalonians is also the “abomination of
					desolation”. Three and one half years after the confirmation of the covenant, he
					will sit in the rebuilt temple of Jerusalem and claim to be God. Most believe
					that he will claim to be all god’s and all messiahs. He will probably claim to
					be the god of Islam, Buddhism, etc. When you see this happen, you will know
					without a doubt that he is the Antichrist.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Abomination of Desolation marks the beginning of the Great Tribulation.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						Matt 24:15 <span class="auto-style1">

				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/rapture" target="_blank">See more information on the timing of the tribulation, here</a>
				</p>
				<a name="tribulation"></a><br />
				<p>
					<b>The Great Tribulation </b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Daniel 11 and 12 show the Antichrist&#39;s
					reign and specifically states that there will be 1290 days (3.53 years) from the
					time of the Abomination of Desolation until the “end of these things”. And
					another specifically stating that there will be “a time (one year), times (two
					years) and an half (half a year)” (3.5 years) till all things shall be finished.
					There will be a time of trouble (Dan 12:1) such as never was (the great
					tribulation), the people that know God will be strong (Dan 11:32), some of those
					shall fall (Dan 11:35), but the wise shall understand while the wicked will not
					(Dan 12:10). Blessed is he who waits until 1335 days (Dan 12:12). When we look
					at all the scriptures describing this period of time, we see that the 3.5
					years will be the time of the wrath of Satan, and the last 45 or 75 days will be
					the wrath of God (the 7 Vials), sometime between the 1260<sup>th</sup> day and
					the 1335<sup>th</sup> day.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Revelation 13:5 we see that power is given to the Antichrist for 42 months
					(3.5 years).
				</p>
				<p>
					In Revelation 12 we see that the devil will be cast to earth, having great wrath
					because he knows his time is short, and that it will be for 1260 days in v.6,
					and a time, times and half a time in v.14, or 3.5 years.
				</p>
				<p>
					This “time of trouble” that will last 3.5 years, is the time of the wrath of
					Satan. The Vials, which are the wrath of God, will be poured out in the last 75
					days, between the 1260<sup>th</sup> and 1335<sup>th</sup> days, possibly just in
					the last 45 days. The 3.5 years of great tribulation will be for the saints of
					God, not the world as a whole (Luke 17:26-30, 1 Thess 5:1-4, Rev 7:9-14).
					Matthew 24:15-21 shows us that when we see this abomination of desolation that
					then there shall be great tribulation, and then (Matt 24:29) immediately after
					the tribulation we will see the sixth seal and the seventh trumpet and we will
					be gathered to the Lord at that time. This also most likely begins the pouring
					of the vials. The saints will NOT be here for the vials (the wrath of God)(1
					Thess 1:10 and Rom 5:9). The wrath of God will be to “destroy them which destroy
					the earth” (Rev 11:18).
				</p>
				<p>
					The Antichrist will rule during this time
					and will implement the mark of the beast and it will be a terrible time for the
					people of God. At the end of this period, Jesus comes back for His faithful at
					the sounding of the Seventh Trumpet. This is the second coming of Jesus Christ!
					This trumpet brings the battle of Armageddon where Israel is saved by God, the
					destruction of the Antichrist and the false prophet, and the binding of Satan
					for 1000 years. This Trumpet, the sixth Seal and all of the Vials bring the
					Wrath of God down on the earth. Jesus will wipe out the armies coming down
					against Israel at Armageddon and there will be an earthquake that is felt around
					the world, plagues and many terrible things because of mankind’s denial of God.
					Fortunately God’s people will not have to endure this wrath as we will be taken
					up at the sound of the Trumpet before God’s wrath is poured out on the earth.
					And then it ushers in the millennium reign of Christ and the end of worldly
					governments. Imagine a world ruled by a loving King such as Jesus Christ for
					1000 years, with no wars or strife at all. Wow.
				</p>
				<p>
					The bible tells any Jews still in the area of Judea (the West Bank) to flee when
					they see the Abomination of Desolation! It tells them not to even get a change
					of clothes but to flee immediately! During this final 3 ½ years, Israel will be
					carried on Eagles Wings. Many people teach that this is the US, and it could be.
					The US is Israel’s only friend today and it looks like the US will continue to
					be her friend. This definitely does <b>not</b> mean for sure that the US will be
					the protective force that the bible is referring to here, however. There are two
					reasons for saying this:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							The combined end time one world government that is ruled by the Antichrist
							(depicted in Revelation 13:2) does not have the eagles wings we saw in Daniel.
							This probably means that the US is not part of that system. The Antichrist will
							be fighting wars during his reign and it&#39;s possible that the US is one of those
							battlefronts. It&#39;s also possible that the US will not come out of the 6th
							Trumpet war unscathed. The US could be destroyed or hurt so badly that it isn&#39;t
							a major player in the world after that.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The description of the eagles wings in Revelation is very similar to the wording
							used in Exodus when Israel was brought out of Egypt.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					<i>
						Exodus 19:4 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on
						eagles&#39; wings, and brought you unto myself.
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						Rev 12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she
						might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a
						time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					We cannot know for sure that the &quot;wings of a great eagle&quot; in Revelation is
					definitely referring to the US. If you live in the US and you&#39;re still riding
					the fence and/or haven&#39;t decided if you really believe all this or haven&#39;t fully
					committed to God, I would give it some very serious thought.

						Rev 13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and
						bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 17 And that
						no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast,
						or the number of his name.

				</p>
				<p>
					Today, people are being implanted with RFID chips and a National Id card was
					required of everyone in the US by 2008, but has been extended, with a similar
					system being set up in Europe. Speculation is that the Antichrist will implement
					a world wide numbering system and most likely will cause everyone to have a chip
					implanted in the right hand or the forehead with their ID number. With current
					technology, this would not be that hard to implement. And recently people have
					begun to use a tattoo ink on animals that has the same capacity as a chip for
					containing RFID information! Now wouldn&#39;t that be considered a “mark”? I cannot
					stress enough that you cannot take that mark! It will most likely come with a
					“pledge of allegiance” to the New World Order or to the name of the Antichrist
					or something similar and they will probably accuse you of being a terrorist or a
					non-conformist and a menace to society if you refuse to take that pledge, and
					condemn you for refusal. As we learned in chapter 7, it is very likely that it
					will be a Muslim Antichrist and Islam will be the religion that is forced on the
					world. It&#39;s likely that everyone will be forced to become a Muslim or be killed.
					Another interesting fact to this discussion is that Muslims wear arm bands and
					head bands to signify their allegiance. It&#39;s possible that this could be the
					“mark” of the beast since by wearing it you “show your allegiance” and are
					marked as a loyal Muslim.

				<p>
					<i>
						Rev 14:9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any
						man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in
						his hand, 10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is
						poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be
						tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the
						presence of the Lamb: 11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever
						and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his
						image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. 12 Here is the patience of
						the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of
						Jesus.
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					Keep the faith as mentioned in verse 12 and be patient! If you do not, you will
					suffer infinitely more than a few hunger pangs and persecution, or even death!
					Do not take the mark!
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>The End of Suffering and Death </b>
				</p>
				<p>
					The battle of Armageddon and the seventh trumpet at the end of the seven years
					mark the end of suffering and the beginning of the Kingdom of God!
				</p>
				<p>
					The bible tells us that after the seventh trumpet, when all is said and done,
					Jesus will set up His kingdom on earth and we will reign with Him for a thousand
					years. The bible doesn’t say that all of mankind is destroyed at the last trump,
					and it’s pretty clear that people will still be alive on earth during that
					millennium. One of the scriptures that
					show this to be true is; <i>
						Daniel
						7:12 As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away:
						yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
					</i>
					This is talking about what happens after
					the Antichrist is thrown into hell at the end of the tribulation. Satan
					will be bound for the entirety of that time and released only at the end for a
					while where he will again deceive the people of the earth. There’s one last
					battle and apparently there will be people who side with Satan to make war with
					Jesus. I, for the life of me, can’t understand this, but I guess I should just
					be grateful that I don’t understand, because maybe I would be like them if I
					understood them. After the end of that millennium, Satan is cast into Hell
					forever, and God makes a new heaven and a new earth for us to enjoy for
					eternity! And there will be no more pain or sorrow… ever…
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						Rev 20:6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on
						such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of
						Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. 7 And when the thousand years
						are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, 8 And shall go out to
						deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog,
						to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
						9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the
						saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven,
						and devoured them. 10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of
						fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be
						tormented day and night for ever and ever. 11 And I saw a great white throne,
						and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and
						there was found no place for them. 12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand
						before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the
						book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in
						the books, according to their works. 13 And the sea gave up the dead which were
						in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they
						were judged every man according to their works. 14 And death and hell were cast
						into the lake of fire. This is the second death. 15 And whosoever was not found
						written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
					</i>

				<p>
					<i>
						Revelation 21:1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven
						and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.

				<p>
					<i>
						Rev 21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall

					<strong>
						A summary of Prophecies and what to expect in the coming days
					</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					God told us many things about His plan in symbolic terms before they happen so
					that we would know what to expect. Many, many prophecies were given about Christ
					and about the times after Him all the way to the end of Gods plan and into
					eternity where He will dwell among us forever. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/BiblicalProphecy" target="_blank">[see Book 1]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					I won&#39;t go into all of the specific prophecies in this summary but will pull
					them together to look at the plan as God has stated it in many different ways.
					There are many prophecies that tie into other prophecies and have common
					intersection points and common end points. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/revelation" target="_blank">[see Chapter 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The big picture starts in the book of Daniel where we are given a time frame of
					490 years. The prophecy is split in parts in the scriptures where from the time
					after the Babylonian captivity from when Jerusalem was restored and rebuilt, to
					the Messiah is 483 years, and then another 7 year period that has yet to happen.
					Revelation gives us another look at the birth of Christ, the devils attempt to
					kill Him at His birth, and then a jump to the last years where the devil is
					thrown to earth and the time of the Great Tribulation comes upon the world.
					Daniel and Revelation also give us a lot of information about what the world
					will look like in terms of the nations of the world and religions of the world
					that will exist at the end time, and what the antichrist and false prophet will
					do to deceive the whole world (except for the Saints of God) at the end time.
					<a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">[see Chapters 7, 8, 10 and other parts of Book 1]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>A quick look at the prophecies leading up to today</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					After the time of Jesus, some of the prophecies given by Jesus while He was here
					on earth came to pass. Like the destruction of the Temple by the Romans.
					<a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/JesusFulfilled" target="_blank">[see Chapters 2 and 3]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					After that, the spirits of Catholicism, Capitalism, Communism and Islam are sent
					into the world (the first four seals). During the last 1700 years or so, these
					spirits have been working. This is very important to understand. These spirits
					control the majority of the world today. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/FourHorsemen" target="_blank">[see Chapter 5]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Then in the last approximately 100 years we <span style="text-decoration:underline">might</span> have
					seen some of the Trumpets with World War 1, World War 2, the
					Chernobyl nuclear accident and the shortening of the days (the first four
					trumpets). There has been more death in the last 100 years than in the entire
					history of man, since the flood; due to wars, abortions, accidents like
					Chernobyl, etc. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/7Trumpets" target="_blank">[see Chapter 6]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The next events that may or may not have already happened are the fifth seal and
					fifth trumpet. The fifth seal is the souls under the altar are told to rest just
					a little longer. Some people teach that the fifth trumpet could have been the gulf war, but I've found that it
					is not (all aspects of an event we think might be fulfillment of prophecy have to fit perfectly or it is NOT that event).
					<a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/FourHorsemen" target="_blank">[see Chapters 5 and 6]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>What we&#39;re waiting for in the near future</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					The sixth trumpet will also sound at some point, but it&#39;s not certain if it will
					be before or after the Confirmation of the Covenant. This is a war that will
					kill a third of mankind, very likely to be World War 3. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/7Trumpets" target="_blank">[see Chapter 6, 7 and 8]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The event we&#39;re looking for right now, that could happen any day, is the
					Confirmation of the Covenant. The confirmation of the covenant is this: there
					will be an international agreement to confirm the status of Jerusalem and the
					permanent borders of Israel. These things are being fought over right now with
					the Palestinians. The bible says that the Antichrist will confirm the covenant
					along with many others for 7 years. This event will be the beginning of the last
					7 years of Daniels 490 years. It may be hard to identify the Antichrist at that
					time because he will be just one of many. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">[see Chapters 7 and 8]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Approximately 8 months (.7 years) after the Confirmation of the Covenant, the
					Antichrist will begin to take over the world. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">[see Chapters 7, 8 and 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Antichrist and the false prophet will team up around this time.
					<a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">[see Chapters 7, 8 and 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Jewish temple will be rebuilt and animal sacrifices will be resumed by the
					Jews. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">[see Chapters 7, 8 and 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Jerusalem will be “surrounded by armies”, which is likely a picture of it being
					policed by UN and/or other forces to force peace in the Middle East. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">
						[see Chapters 7, 8 and 10]
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					In the midst of this last 7 years (three and one half years in), the Antichrist
					will cause the animal sacrifices being performed in the rebuilt temple to cease,
					and will cause the “abomination of desolation” by either claiming to be God or
					acting in the place of God. That is when we will definitely know who he is. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">
						[see Chapters 7, 8 and 10]
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The false prophet will cause the world to worship the Antichrist. This will be
					made possible by the power given him by the devil himself. He will perform
					miracles before the world, like pulling fire from the sky.
					<a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">[see Chapters 7, 8	and 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					God&#39;s two witnesses will begin their prophecy at this time. They will not be
					able to be killed for the whole 3.5 years but will be killed at the very end.
					<a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">[see Chapters 7, 8 and 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The bible tells us that they (the world) shall say, “peace and safety”. This is
					the call of the New World Order. The Antichrist will come in the name of peace
					to take over the world, and the bible says that the people of the world will be
					thinking they&#39;ve finally made it, reveling and partying, proclaiming that
					mankind has finally done it and brought peace to the world!
					<a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">
						[see Chapters 7, 8,	9 and 10]
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Antichrist will implement what&#39;s called the mark of the beast. It will very
					likely be a RFID type of system. They can put a chip under your skin today and
					they even have a tattoo ink that is RFID capable, so maybe that will be
					utilized. What&#39;s certain is that this will be forced upon all people and you
					won&#39;t be able to get a job, buy food, go to the doctor, have a bank account, or
					pretty much have any way to “buy or sell” unless you submit. This will
					undoubtedly come with some sort of oath or pledge of allegiance to the
					Antichrist and his government. It may even mean conversion to Islam. <u>
						This
						will also be a superhighway straight to hell
					</u>. Any person who takes the mark
					of the beast is condemned by God. It will be a horrible time for the people who
					worship the one true God, Jesus Christ. This is what is termed as the Great
					Tribulation. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">[see Chapters 7, 8 and 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Antichrist will “cause craft to prosper”. He will “understand dark
					sentences”. There will very likely be many people who will start to use dark and
					evil power to perform sorcery and witchcraft. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">[see Chapters 7, 8 and 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>What will the world of the end time look like?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>The nations of the end time</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					The empires of the world from Babylon to today were foretold and since we live
					in a time where history proves what those prophecies were, we have the unique
					pleasure of seeing prophecy unfold. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/ModernNations" target="_blank">[see Chapters 4, 7, 8 and 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Daniel gives us two symbolic pictures of the end time governments.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							In one perspective we see that there will be 4 kingdoms in existence at the end
							time and they will exist when Jesus returns, conquers them, and sets up His
							kingdom on the earth. These kingdoms mentioned specifically are Britain, Russia,
							Germany, and the final government of the New World Order that the Antichrist
							will rule. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/ModernNations" target="_blank">[see Chapter 4]</a>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							In the other perspective we see that the Medes and the Persians rule after
							Babylon, then the Greek empire, then the Roman, and finally the Holy Roman /
							Islamic Ottoman co-empires. Both of these final empires together comprised the
							total area controlled by the Roman Empire. From the Bible and
							history we learn that the final Antichrist empire will be a revived version of
							the empire that succeeds the Roman Empire. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">[see Chapter 7]</a>
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					The bible tells us that this final (divided, co-empire) will be used as the
					world government of the Antichrist and his false prophet. The Antichrist will
					bring the Muslim world together, reviving the Ottoman empire, while the false
					prophet will bring in Europe, reviving the Holy Roman empire, and the two will
					unite them as one. The bible tells us that the Antichrist will rule the whole
					world, but it also says that during this last 3.5 years he will be fighting wars
					as he conquers more and more nations. Not all nations will fall under his rule
					in so short a time (the area which is now Jordan is one that is specifically
					mentioned to “escape out of his hand”, among others), but he will rule the last
					world dominating empire. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">[see Chapters 7, 8 and 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>The religion of the end time</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					The religion of the end time will be one where the false prophet will deceive
					the whole world and cause the world to worship the Antichrist by doing miracles
					such as pulling fire from the sky. This religion already exists but will be made
					universal by the power given the Antichrist and the false prophet by the devil.
					The bible doesn&#39;t specifically tells us what that religion will be called, but
					we can determine what it will be by looking at the facts. The world is pretty
					much dominated by Christianity and Islam. While Hinduism, Atheism and Communism
					make up most of the remainder, it doesn&#39;t look like they will play much of a
					role in the end time. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">[see Chapters 7, 8 and 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Christianity today is full of churches proclaiming that all religions worship
					the same God and therefore we should embrace them. The Catholic church promotes
					that idea with Interfaith doctrine and goes as far as to state in the Catechism
					that the Muslims worship the same God as Christianity and therefore will enjoy
					the same salvation equally. This means that they think it doesn&#39;t matter if
					you&#39;re a Christian or a Muslim and that you can find salvation through either
					religion. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">[see Chapters 7, 8 and 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Muslims, on the other hand, have no such belief. In fact, Muslim doctrine
					teaches that Jesus is just a prophet, not the manifestation of God in the flesh,
					and that He will return at the end time to teach Christians the Muslim way and
					convert them. The prophecies of the Bible and the Muslim prophecies concerning
					the Antichrist (the Muslim Mahdi) and the false prophet (the Muslim Jesus)
					mirror each other but the good guys of Islam are the bad guys of the Bible. This
					is a very good indication that the Antichrist will rise as the Mahdi of Islam
					and will unite the Christian world with him via the false prophet and create a
					global Islamic religion. The bible tells us that this end time religion will be
					forced upon people or they will be killed if they refuse. The Muslim prophecies
					tell us that the Muslims will kill any who won&#39;t convert to Islam.
					<a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/PresentDay" target="_blank">
						[see Chapters 7, 8 and 10]
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>What then?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Then, “sudden destruction shall come upon them”. With a shout, with the sound of
					a trumpet, Jesus will come with power and glory as the lightning comes from the
					east to the west. The whole world will see him. The Lord will return and He will
					reap His own, gathering them up to Him in the clouds, and then the wrath of God
					will be poured out on the world. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/rapture" target="_blank">[see Chapters 9 and 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					When Jesus touches down on the Mount of Olives it will split and the world will
					shake with the greatest earthquake the world has never seen. It will rock the
					entire world and Rome will be destroyed. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/revelation" target="_blank">[see Chapter 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					He will wipe out the armies gathered for the Battle of Armageddon and will set
					up the Kingdom of God and will reign on the earth with His saints for 1000
					years. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/revelation" target="_blank">[see Chapter 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					There will be unsaved people remaining alive on the earth. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/revelation" target="_blank">[see Chapter 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Antichrist and the false prophet are tossed into the lake of fire. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/revelation" target="_blank">
						[see Chapter 10]
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Satan is bound for the 1000 years. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/revelation" target="_blank">[see Chapter 10]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					After 1000 years Satan is loosed and again deceives the people of the earth and
					comes against God only to be wiped out with fire from heaven. [see Chapter 10]
				</p>

					Judgment day. <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/revelation" target="_blank">[see Chapter 10]</a>

				<p>
					<em>Ps 104:6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains. 7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. 8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.</em>

						This map shows where God caused the deep valleys and the mountain chains to remove the water from the flood, and it's exactly where the earth is weak and eroding to the point

						There are a number of other things that show us where we are in the timeline of the Lords EndTime events...
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						One that gives us a pretty clear picture of timeline is that Islam is almost certainly the 4th Seal (Rev 6 Seal and Zech 6 Spirit), and we're told specifically that the Green Horse is
						given power over a <span class="auto-style1">fourth part</span> of the earth.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>
						Rev 6:8 And I looked, and behold a pale
					</em>(remember, this is actually green)<em>
						horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over
						the <span class="auto-style1">fourth part of the earth</span> to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.

				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						Islam grew from 1.48 billion in 2008 to 1.8 billion in 2015 (approximates).  It's estimated that Islam is almost exactly 25% of the world today (2017). At that rate of growth it could not be too many more
						years before they go beyond a "fourth part".
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						So if Islam is the fourth Seal, it would not match prophecy if the day of the Lord were to be as long as 50 years from now.  Projected growth would put Islam at much more than 25% by then.

				<p>
					<a name="6000years"></a>

							6000 years from creation to today!
						</span>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						The Bible shows the exact years from Creation to Abraham (approx 2000 years).
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						Adam was 130 years old when he begat Seth, who was 105 years old when he begat Enos, who was 90 years old when he begat Cainan, who was 70 years old when he begat Mahalaleel, who was 65
						years old when he begat Jared, who was 162 years old when he begat Enoch, who was 65 years old when he begat Methuselah, who was 187 years old when he begat Lamech, who was 182
						years old when he begat Noah, who was 500 years old when he begat Shem, who was 100 years old when he begat Arphaxad, who was 35 years old when he begat Selah, who was 30
						years old when he begat Eber, who was 34 years old when he begat Peleg, who was 30 years old when he begat Reu, who was 32 years old when he begat Serug, who was 30
						years old when he begat Nahor, who was 29 years old when he begat Terah, who was 70 years old when he begat Abraham, who was 100 when he begat Isaac. Total of 1946 years from
						Creation to Abraham (2046 to when God made the promises to Abraham and Isaac was born).
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						Then, we see it was another 2000 years from Abraham to Jesus.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">

								And to thy seed, which is Christ. 17 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ,
								the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.
							</em>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									From the time of the promise to bringing Israel out of Egypt and creation of the Law, was about 430 years.

							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<em>
								Acts 7:6 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage,
								and entreat them evil four hundred years.
							</em>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									Abraham was 100 when he begat Isaac, so his "seed" sojourned in a strange land (the area of Egypt) about 400 years until God brought Israel out of Egypt.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>

					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The time Israel spent in the wilderness was 40 years.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>

						it is highly likely that the return of Christ will be during the Fall Feasts in the year 2032, which would be almost
						exactly 2000 years from His death, burial and resurrection!
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Excerpt below:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Considering several different variables, it seems most likely for the Confirmation of the Covenant to happen in the year 2025,
							with the Return of Christ in the year 2032. <br /><br /> My reasoning is:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>
									The lunar calendar is the basis for the Jewish calendar and when we look at the number of lunar cycles from year to year, it makes logical sense that the
									events will happen in a seven year lunar cycle that matches the time frames the Lord gave us concerning the time of the Antichrist.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>
											The seven year period of 2017 through 2024 matches this pattern and ends with a partial lunar eclipse around the time of the feasts
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											The next seven year period that matches is 2022 through 2029 and ends with a total lunar eclipse, but the eclipse is in December outside of the time of the feasts...
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											The next seven year period that matches is 2025 through 2032 and this period ends with the next Blood Moon Tetrad around the time of the feasts
										</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									The Blood Moon Tetrad in 2032 matches what we know about the final events
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>
											Rev 6:12-17 and Matt 24:29 - see Chart A, here: <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/revelation#AutoNumber1" target="_blank">Chart A showing the final events of this age</a>
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											And Chart B further down on that page: The moon becomes as blood or is darkened in Rev 6, Joel 2 and 3, Matt 24, and Zechariah 14.
										</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									This also aligns perfectly with what I believe (implicit in scripture) is God&#39;s timetable of 7 total days (1000 years X 7) for this part of His plan for
									creation before we move to the next stage into eternity.&nbsp; 4 thousand years (the first 4 days) from the creation of the universe and the earth, to His death, burial and resurrection
									at age 33 when His ministry was finished at His first coming (It&#39;s unlikely that on exactly January 1, year 0 Christ was born but is within a year or two
									plus or minus). Another 2 thousand years from then to now, for a total of 6 days so far. And then the final day, which will be the millennial reign of Christ.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									It is also almost certain that we are in the very last of the last days before the coming of the Lord. It's extreemly unlikely that my generation will pass away before He returns,
									as He said in Matthew 24:35. All the signs He gave us in that prophecy are certainly coming to pass right now!
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>
											Also, when we look at all the other prophecies of the last days, the 4 spirits in the world (Revelation 6:1-8 and Zechariah 6:1-8), the 4 beasts (kings/nations)
											of Daniel 7 that become one in Rev 13, the "falling away" of true believers, the uprooting of the 3 kings of Daniel 7 and Revelation 17, etc... it's obvious in my mind.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											The coming of the final 7 years is certainly imminent!
										</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						Please NOTE!  I am <em>NOT</em> saying this is a fact, or that this is definitely the year of Christ's return, not by any means!  I'm stating this as a likelihood based on
						study of prophecy and truth in the Bible.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						But wait, there's a few more things to consider...
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						Since it's a possibility that the first four Trumpets have blown, it's very interesting that "time" appears to fly these days.  Even with children.  I remember as a child how
						summer seemed to last forever, but when my kids were in school I asked them if it seemed that way, but they told me it seemed like it was there and gone, even when they were out of
						school for 2 and a half months.  God has changed time?  4th trumpet?
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						The 6th trumpet shows a war that will kill a third of mankind, and will have an army of 200 million.  This is now a reality in that this is the size of the army China can field in a war...
						There are 200 million men of military age in China today.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						The Jewish temple is ready for rebuild.  They have the blueprints, all the utensils and clothing, furniture, and everything necessary to build the third temple in Jerusalem. In 2007
						I stood next to the cornerstone that they have ready to place when they get the go-ahead to build the temple. They are secretly building the temple off-site just as the first temple
						was built. Jews today are clamoring to get it done so they can resume animal sacrifices and resume all the rituals in the temple.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						Knowledge in the End Time will increase...  how much has knowledge increased in the last few decades? By leaps and bounds it has grown!
					</span>
					<em>Daniel 12:4 ...&#39;even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.&#39;</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						We have the ability to enforce the mark of the beast in Rev 13.  Today they are already using chips under the skin and RFID tattoos on animals and people.  This is the mechanism
						that will almost certainly be used by the Antichrist to impose sanctions on individuals.  It's also interesting to know that Islamic signs of compliance for Jihad are represented
						by headbands and armbands on the right arm, which are the two areas mentioned in the Bible where the mark will be placed.
					</span>
					<em>
						Revelation 13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 17
						And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
					</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						If you've been keeping track of world news, you probably know that the Confirmation of the covenant is imminent!  Russia and several Arab nations are acknowledging the right of
						Israel to exist!  This is the first time in history!
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						Does this sound like the world of today?  Most definitely!
					</span>
					<em>
						2 Timothy 3:1-5 .....&#39;This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be <u>lovers of their own selves</u>,
						covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent,
						fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, <u>lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God</u>;
					</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						World Peace... the goal of the whole world...  also the call of the New World Order, "Peace and Safety".
					</span>
					<em>
						1 Thess 5:3 For when they shall say, Peace and safety ; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
					</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						The Bible says the Gospel will be preached to all the world...  Today we are in the deepest jungles, everywhere on the planet, and the whole world has heard the gospel.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						The falling away is happening NOW.  Paul tells us in 2 Thess 2:3 that the Day of the Lord will not come until there's a falling away first. It's happening by leaps and bounds
						and there is hardly anywhere, in any church, where you can actually find the truth being taught. People have fallen so far from truth that it doesn't exist any more in the hearts and minds of men!
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						Prophecy can now be understood!  The words were closed up and sealed by God, until the time of the end.  Now that it's the time of the end, the words are no longer sealed up!  We can
						understand them! <a href="https://www.bibleprophecyandtruth.com/prophecy/BiblicalProphecy" target="_blank">See more on this, here</a>
					</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<em>Dan 12:9 And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						Jesus said it would be as the days of Lot and Noah when He returns. The days of rampant homosexuality are on us...  the thoughts of mens hearts are only evil continually...
					</span>
					<em>
						Luke 17:26 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. 27 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage,
						until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. 28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought,
						they sold, they planted, they builded; 29 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. 30 Even thus shall it be
						in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
					</em>
					<br /><br />
					<em>
						Gen 6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
					</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="newStyle1">
						My friends, we are there.  There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that the time is now.  Not 40 or 50 years from now.  Now.
